The `music_circ` dataset contains 176,012 observations (rows), each representing one circulation event/transaction
that occured between Jan 1, 2014 and Jan 1, 2019 at the Duke Music Library or the Duke Library Service Center, a large off-site
warehouse from which books are transferred back and forth. Here are the ~26 variables for each event:

- `date_time` - the timestamp of the circulation transaction, with precision to the minute.
    - `year`, `month`, `date`, `day`, `hour`, `minute` - individual components of the timestamp. `day` is the day of the
      week (ex. `"Friday"`).

    - `Music Library` - the item permanently resides in the stacks of the Music Library
    - `Library Service Center` - the item is stored in the off-campus Service Center warehouse

    - `Simple Loan` - a standard loan of an item to a patron
    - `Transfer Loan` - event representing an item being checked out to be routed to a different Duke sub-library
    - `Item Declared Lost`
- `event_category` - a simplified factor variable representing what kind of activity: `return`, `loan`, or `other`.
- `status_on_event` - the item status status at the time of the event. Could represent, for example, what kinds of loans
  are permitted for that item.
- `process_id` - the item process status code, representing the point in the item lifecycle
    - `process_desc` - friendly text version of the process status
- `collection_id` - the library collection to which the item belongs
    - `collection_desc` - some collections have friendly names
- `format` - the format of the item (ex. `"Books"`, `"Music"`, etc.)
- `barcode` - unique identifier for every item in the library system
- `ISBN` - the international series book number, if applicable
- `title` - the title of the material
- `topic` - the name of the corresponding Library of Congress call number topic code of the item
    - `topic_category` - a simplified categorization of general subject matter
- `language` - the source language of the material
- `publication_date` - the year of publication of the material
- `arrival_date` - the date that the item was originally added to the library's inventory
- `patron_type` - the type of patron checking out or returning the material. For example, undergrad, grad student, faculty, etc.
- `patron_status` - the status level of the patron checking out or returning the material. Alumni, a *BorrowDirect* library, etc.
