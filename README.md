# Duke Music Library Circulation and Item Analysis

## Summary

This project will focus on a dataset consisting of materials circulation records from the Duke University Music Library.
The Duke Music Library has a large collection of materials, consisting of musical scores, music literature and theory books,
CDs, DVDs, microfilms, vinyl records, and others. The majority of materials are available to circulate among students, grad
students, faculty members, and other members of the library. The central library circulation software, ALEPH, keeps records
of every single circulation transaction (check-out, loans, returns, missing items, etc.), and historical data is available 
for the past several years of activity.

With this data, we hope to answer questions that will allow us to present recommendations to the music libraries to help them 
make their transaction processes more efficient. We hope to explore the factors that predict transactions so that we may make 
inferences about the data. One question might be what features are typical of the most commonly loaned publications. 
We can also examine data such as the time it takes for publications on hold to be delivered to the holders to analyze the
inefficiencies of the current system. These inefficiencies will allow us to offer our recommendations on the storage of items
and processing of transactions to save the libraries time and money.
